Hi!

First off, thanks for downloading my pixel art logos. I hope they are useful to you.

They are organized as so:

LOGOS -- Just the plain old logos on a transparent background (useful for image-links).
BACKGROUNDS -- The logo, with a nicely colored background (useful for profile-pics).
BACKGROUNDS + DROPSHADOWS -- The logo on a colored background, with an added drop shadow to make it look all nice and fancy (useful for fancy profile pics).
DROPSHADOWS -- Just like above, except without the background color, this time the background is transparent (useful for fancy image-links).

If you liked to say hi, support me, get updates on other free assets, or just yell at me for not including <'insert website name here'>, feel free to follow me at these places:
